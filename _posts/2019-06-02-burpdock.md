# How to setup Burp Suite inside a docker container

First we create a new directory - `burpdock`  
Inside the directory, create the following `Dockerfile`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ujjwal96/1181d442b2a92067b5f3f111d5b3b69e.js?file=Dockerfile"></script>

Then we create a build script. You can directly give the command but I personally like using a script to avoid giving all the args whenever I want a build a new version.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ujjwal96/1181d442b2a92067b5f3f111d5b3b69e.js?file=build"></script>

Make the script executable and run it  
```
chmod +x build
./build
```
Finally make the `start` script to run the container.  
## NOTE: This may overwrite your existing burp settings. Make a backup `mv ~/.java/.userPrefs/burp/prefs.xml ~/.java/.userPrefs/burp/prefs.xml.bkp`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ujjwal96/1181d442b2a92067b5f3f111d5b3b69e.js?file=start"></script>

Make the script executable and run it  
```
chmod +x start
./start
```
After that simply run - `burpsuite` and you will see it open
